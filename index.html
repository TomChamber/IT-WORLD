<Tom>
<P> My name is Tom and my student number is S3948171, I come from a vietnamese background and my personal hobbies to do during my spare time is to surf the web or to watch videos on youtube. Web design is the part about IT that I am the most interested in and it’s also my most enjoyable part about the component. Although I have no actual personal experience in designing a website myself, personally I have tried to create some before through third party websites like skillshare and shopify which allow users to easily create websites.</p>

<h3> 7.	Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h3>

<h4> Andrew: </h4>
<p> -	Having looked at the data, I’ve decided to keep my ideal job as a software developer. But instead of Python, I’ll focus on Java instead as Java developers are in higher demand than Python </p>

<h4> Sahan: </h4> 
<p> -	After looking at the data from burning glass technologies, i have started expanding my horizons by thinking about jobs such as a graphic designer and network engineer since they are in high demand. I will take these careers into account along with my original ideal job as a cybersecurity analyst as they seem interesting and important to the information technology industry. </p>

<h4> Ayrtaan: </h4>
<p> -	After looking at the burning glass data, I started thinking about broadening my search of jobs in I.T past Cyber-Security. I was surprised at how Graphic Design was so high in demand, and I've decided to learn codes such as Java as Java developers are also high in demand. </p>

<h4> Tom: </h4>
<p> -	After looking at the data from the burning glass technologies. I see that my original desire Job is still the Job I want to pursue as a future career, and I'll continue to focus on web design and to further improve and study the concept of new design which I will use in the future, while still considering different career path like cybersecurity and data analyst. </p>

<h4> Tri: </h4>
<p> -	After considering the Burning Glass’s data, I am convinced to continue to pursue a career in software engineering. This is due to the high demand from the labor market, which may be accompanied by bright job prospects. Also, I believe that learning front-end technologies is useful for me to succeed in the IT industry because knowledge in those technologies is so highly valued and strongly demanded by employers. </p>

<h4> Tommy: </h4>
<p> -After looking at the Burning data, I would still want to do something related to PC's and rerparing or making them as it is a job I know I would enjoy. This descion is due to me not wanting to waste my time doing something I do not enjoy and would much rather invest my time doing something I really enjoy. All though this choice might make less money than the other and more demanding ones, it is still comfortable income.

  <p> In the field of Information Technology, Zach works for a hospital as an Information Systems Technician where he helps support close to 2000 people and over 1000 devices.</p>

<p> Some of the things that he does on a day to day basis includes general help desk ticketing management, Active Directory management, group policy management, and imaging using Microsoft Deployment Tool-kit.</p>

He works in a Windows 7 operated environment at the time of the video, and was updating some of their Windows XP machines while moving away from Server 2003. 

<p> The ticketing system he uses is called “Service Desk”, which he recommends thoroughly. Everyday he checks tickets while also answering phone calls with Shoretel phones. He spends his time at multiple different locations in the day as he makes frequent visits to the hospital’s various clinics and their general facility to manage things and interact with patients, clients and other staff. He finds this task tedious and considers it the most challenging part of his job. Additionally, his work is focused on user account creation and active directory, which includes him creating user accounts, email accounts, and managing users. He also does a lot of computer imaginings.</p>

<p> Compared with other I.T professionals, Zach’s position has him being more active and moving around. His environment is constantly changing as he is in sort of a leadership position and has the need to check on various things.

<p>Peter is a computer network technician. His position typically has him working on networks, hardware, software and computer equipment.  Examples of these could be;  deploying a new workstation, fixing a wireless access point, replacing a printer/fixing a printer problem. A normal work day would have him check the monitoring and reporting service that they use for any occurrences of outages overnight, and then he would take any tickets that have been left-over from the other day and prioritize his work. 

He often interacts with service providers for support with Xerox machines, and would often have to go on site to call a customer to arrange that they're there.  However, being on site is hard as he needs to make sure he isn’t interrupting any work that's currently being done. 

What he really likes about this career is that it “is changing all the time in a good, positive way."

His position differs from other I.T professionals as he works for a smaller company which means he gets to do a lot of different jobs, which he enjoys. He has a very broad education in Information Technology and even in business which allows him to be in various positions, unlike some other I.T professionals who might only have one area of interest.

<p> Paray is an I.T professional in the United Kingdom. He works for the company NHS as an I.T support technician. He moved to the U.K from Nigeria for education purposes, and now has a job there.</p>

<p> His work typically involves fixing and replacing various computer parts such as monitors. He doesn’t seem to interact with clients or the general public much, only really talking to other I.T professionals and supervisors. </p>

<p> Paray spends most of his time indoors, updating and maintaining the desktops of his colleagues. </p>   

<p> Paray’s position in I.T is a very typical one, something you’d immediately think of when you hear “I.T professional”. As an I.T support technician, his position doesn’t differ much from other I.T professionals.

<p> Chris Mendez is a network engineer that works for NexGenT.</p> 

<p>First thing he likes to do in a day is to make sure there isn’t anything wrong with the switch stack, like amber lights being on or lights flickering. He also occasionally does help desk duties. He is also tasked with installing new Cisco switches.</p> 

<p> He spends most of his time in the basement of his work site either updating machines or running maintenance. </p>

<p> He doesn't interact much with other employees unless he is doing help desk duties, which isn’t a part of his actual job. </p> 

<p> He doesn’t find much challenging in his line of work, however, the unpacking and installation of new technologies, while interesting, is also very tedious to him. </p>

<p> Compared to other I.T professionals, Chris has a more diverse background due to his experience with I.T support as well as network engineering. 
</p>

<h3> Anna </h3>
<img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b6df8bb681f89c158b48f6b/5d95f30e6593e813b1ce585d_field-engineer.jpg" width="872" height="321"/>

<p> Anna is a Field Technician for Spectrum. Her position has her do cable installations, internet installations and phone installations. She is off-site, outside in various weather conditions to do her job. </p> 

<p> She is constantly learning, doing something new and has a rapidly changing environment, never being the same.</p>

<p> She meets new people everyday as she is always face to face with her clients. She travels to her clients’ houses and does whatever installation is necessary there, and she is usually climbing telephone poles and going into attics. Since her job is a very hands-on and outdoor one, her work is usually at the mercy of weather conditions. For her, going to work in summer and hot weather conditions is the most challenging aspect of her job. </p>

<p> She enjoys the independence her job offers, however, it is also a challenge as the free-roam nature of her work can seem daunting, which is why she has a support network to fall back on. </p>

<p> Anna’s position wildly differs from others in the I.T field. She is constantly on the move and is almost never at a desk, unlike other I.T professionals. Her job not only requires metal labor, but also physical labor as well.

  <h3>Autonomous cars</h3>
  <p><h4>Sources</h4></p>
                                                    
 <img src="https://scwcontent.affino.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/014/Autonomous-vehicle-AdobeStock_174958313_rm.png"/>      
                                                   
                                                    
                                                    
                                                    
 <p> Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that are capable of driving itself with little to no input or attention from the driver. These vehicles 'rely on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and powerful processors to execute software' (Synopsys n.d.). </p>

<p> The most known brand for autonomous vehicles is Tesla, whose vehicles also all completely run on electricity instead of traditional petrol. Their cars are able to drive completely on their own, meaning the driver can simply relax inside, watch a movie, read or book, or even take a nap. They are also significantly more quiet than traditional petrol cars that use engines. This is due to the fact that Tesla cars run on electric motors with rechargeable batteries. And because they run on electricity, they are also more eco-friendly since there will be no carbon emissions from the exhaust. In addition to that, they are also potentially safer because technology is more consistent than humans, who are more unpredictable. According to the World Health Organisation (2021), 'approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes'. Tesla's latest model, the 'Model 3', is said to ensure the highest amount of safety for the passengers with 'an ANCAP 5-star safety rating overall and in every category' (Tesla, Inc. n.d.). In the future, electric autonomous vehicles will likely become more accessible, meaning that there will potentially be a reduction in road accidents and a reduction in carbon air pollution. </p>

<p> The major impact of autonomous vehicles would be quality of life. It will make getting from one location to another much easier as you wouldn't have to manually drive the car. This would especially benefit elderly people the most who may have difficulty with driving due to complications such as poor eyesight or movement. Carbon emissions could be reduced as there would be less usage of petrol. As autonomous vehicles are closely related to electric vehicles, the switch from petrol/oil to electric will overall benefit us in the long run as oil is a limited resource on our planet. </p>

<p> In my day to day life, an autonomous vehicle can be a drastic improvement in terms of convenience and overall quality of life. Similarly, having a regular car is convenient enough to get to places instead of having to rely on public transport, autonomous cars will have essentially the same benefit but with much less effort. Of course, you would still have to pay attention to the road and your surroundings, but not as much as when you're manually driving a car. </p>

<p> Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Makey Makey are all advanced electronic hardware kits that are easily accessible to almost anyone. All of them achieve similar goals but some can accomplish more advanced/complicated tasks than others. Makey Makey is straightforward and easier to learn, while Raspberry Pi and Arduino are more advanced. Raspberry Pi and Arduino allow for users to create their own devices and develop their own software and programs to enhance their lives. </p>

<p> Raspberry Pi's 4th model is their latest model and is described as 'your tiny, dual-display, desktop computer…and robot brains, smart home hub, media centre, networked AI core, factory controller, and much more' (Raspberry Ltd n.d.). It is great for performing multiple tasks, controlling complex robots, playing videos, connecting to the internet, etc. Unlike their previous models, this one is built with a 'complete desktop experience' (Raspberry Ltd n.d.) that can run with dual-desktop in 4K. And like their previous models, it can also be used for other projects such as making whole new devices. </p>

<p> Arduino has an extensive collection of products under varying categories, where each specialise in their own thing and have their own advantages over other models. Instead of a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi, Arduino is instead a microcontroller. Therefore they are good for repetitive tasks such as turning the lights on and off, opening and closing the garage door, reading the temperature from sensors, etc. Arduino offers kits that contain a multitude of their products to get users started with learning computing. According to Arduino Hardware (n.d.), all their products go under a certain family such as the 'Nano Family', 'MKR Family' and 'Classic Family'. Each of these families have their own uses and advantages over one another, but none of them make another redundant or useless.
 </p>

<p> 'Makey Makey Classic' is Makey Makey's most popular product. It is designed for users aged eight and up and allows for them to turn any everyday object into computer keys and/or controllers. Unlike the other two hardware kits, this one is significantly easier to learn and allows even kids to learn the ideas behind software development and simple computing. </p>

<p> In the years to come, these technologies will allow almost everyone to learn computing, whether it be advanced or easy. People may eventually develop ground-breaking devices that can change people's lives. This will definitely impact our world, where technology is becoming more advanced, and people will be able to create and develop new projects and ideas. In a similar way, this can also affect my life in the same way it will affect other people's lives. Minor inconveniences can be resolved or tasks can be made easier through the usage of these technologies.

<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
 <img src=https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/creating-rolling-out-effective-cyber-security-strategy-1024x440.jpeg.optimal.jpeg width="250" height="250"/>

 <p> Cybersecurity is the approach to protecting and recovering networks, computer systems, programmes, and devices from all types of cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity is critical in any business because information must be kept secure at all times to avoid information leakage to attackers. Cyber-attacks are a growing and evolving threat to sensitive data, with attackers employing new techniques powered by artificial intelligence and social engineering to circumvent traditional data protection controls. Because relying solely on firewalls and antivirus software is unreliable, it is critical to have adequate cybersecurity in place at a business or location where sensitive information must be kept secure.</p>
  
<p> The top cybersecurity service providers are Symantec, Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, Mcafee, and Check Point Software. These companies are world leading in enterprise-grade cybersecurity and they use state-of-the-art technology to provide protection. For instance, they protect data through cloud, infrastructure, and endpoints. Services that they provide include: endpoint security, email security and cloud security, which are all important for a business to have.</p>

<p> There are different types of methods that are used to protect computing resources from being disrupted.  Examples of cybersecurity include: encryption, authentication, authorization, network security, sandboxing, internal controls, security by design, secure coding, secure testing, defence in depth, physical security, audit trail, defensive computing, non-repudiation, security infrastructure, monitoring, vulnerability management and response to breaches.</p>

<p> There are many benefits to cybersecurity. For instance, there is improved recovery time after a breach. This is helpful because it ensures that the attack will not do as much damage to the business if there were no cybersecurity measures in place. The business will be able to recover quickly and continue their day-to-day matters as per usual. Another benefit is that there is enhanced confidence in the credibility and reputation of a company. This would help the company trust their developers, partners, customers, stakeholders, and employees. </p>
  
<p> There will be some potential impacts of cybersecurity in the future. Cybersecurity will ensure that companies' data will be protected from outside threats. As the amount of businesses in the world continues to grow, the demand for cybersecurity specialists will increase. Cybersecurity specialists are people that are held accountable for providing security for software and networks. They have to search for any possible risk in software and hardware systems and ensure they are eradicated. This will create an immense amount of jobs and help decrease unemployment in the future. As time goes on, newer methods of cybersecurity could be developed and implemented into ensuring data security of businesses across the world.  Companies will need to pay these cybersecurity specialists, therefore the need for a cybersecurity specialist  will result in companies having to spend money on these said specialists. Although the companies will have to spend money on the cybersecurity specialists, it will help them be successful in the long term, because their data will be secured. </p>
  
<p> Although speculated by many, cybersecurity jobs are not likely to be automated in the distant future, and it is believed to be one of the most desirable careers. As technology improves every day,  cybersecurity will also improve. Cyber security applications will also improve as they will likely have enhanced features and capabilities which will ensure that data gets protected. </p>
  
<p> I believe cybersecurity will have some effect on my daily life. My ideal job is a position as a cybersecurity analyst, so I would definitely be content with the creation of more jobs for the cybersecurity field within the information technology industry. Cybersecurity is very important and I believe that confidential information and data  must not be leaked. For my friends and family, it is important that they practise cybersecurity, by making even small changes to their daily life. To give an example, a friend could install antivirus and antispyware programs in order to detect, prevent and take action against malicious software in their computer. They could also install a firewall to avoid unauthorised access into or out of their computer network. They could also use Virtual Private Networks so that they can hide their IP address and personal data on Wi-Fi networks. </p> 


<h3>Clouds, Servers, Services </h3>

<p> A cloud server is a centralised virtual server that runs in a cloud computing environment rather than a physical server. It is built, hosted, and delivered over the internet via a cloud computing platform and can be remotely accessed. Cloud servers are self-contained units that contain all of the software needed to function.  These servers are to be accessed on demand by their users. The term "cloud" refers to a collection of internet-connected servers that can be leased as part of a software or application service. Web hosting, data hosting and sharing, and software use are all examples of cloud-based services. Although being a cloud server, it can still perform similar functions to a conventional physical server. </p> 

<p> The best cloud services include: Microsoft OneDrive, IDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, SpiderOak One, Box and Apple iCloud Drive. All these services vary in purpose. For example, iPhone users would use Apple iCloud Drive, whereas Windows users are more inclined to use Microsoft OneDrive to backup their data. The development of technology makes cloud services possible. The need for businesses to store their data on physical servers is no longer necessary as cloud services are here for those purposes.  The difference between a dedicated server and cloud server is that a dedicated server is designed for use by only one company. Due to the advancement in technology over the years, cloud servers can be utilised by multiple users. </p>

<p> An impact of cloud is that computers may boot and run faster since they have fewer programs loaded into the memory. There are also numerous cloud services which means that it will not be an issue for users who can’t afford subscriptions. For example, Google Docs is free to use and any computer with an internet connection can access Google Docs, and all versions of here documents are saved in the cloud. </p> 

<p> Tech analyst Gartner estimates that “by 2025, half of all spending in the application software, infrastructure software, business process services, and system infrastructure markets will have shifted to the cloud, up from 41% in 2022. Cloud computing is expected to account for nearly two-thirds of application software spending by 2022, up from 57.7 percent in 2022.” </p> 

<p> Clouds affects me, my friends and family in everyday life in various ways. For instance, my university work requires me to use cloud services. I use Google Docs to create documents and Outlook to view my email related to university work. Many people I know use iCloud to backup their photos and files because they use Apple devices. The increase in use of cloud computing seems to be a great thing for my friends and family because they use it every day. Cloud computing is also used by people I know for media streaming, banking and ecommerce.It is clear that cloud services will become the norm in the coming years as opposed to utilising a conventional physical server. </p>
