<P> My name is Tom and my student number is S3948171, I come from a vietnamese background and my personal hobbies to do during my spare time is to surf the web or to watch videos on youtube. Web design is the part about IT that I am the most interested in and it’s also my most enjoyable part about the component. Although I have no actual personal experience in designing a website myself, personally I have tried to create some before through third party websites like skillshare and shopify which allow users to easily create websites.</p>

  <h3> Zach </h3>
  <p>In the field of Information Technology, Zach works for a hospital as an Information Systems Technician where he helps support close to 2000 people and over 1000 devices.

Some of the things that he does on a day to day basis includes general help desk ticketing management, Active Directory management, group policy management, and imaging using Microsoft Deployment Tool-kit. 

He works in a Windows 7 operated environment at the time of the video, and was updating some of their Windows XP machines while moving away from Server 2003. 

The ticketing system he uses is called “Service Desk”, which he recommends thoroughly. Everyday he checks tickets while also answering phone calls with Shoretel phones. He spends his time at multiple different locations in the day as he makes frequent visits to the hospital’s various clinics and their general facility to manage things and interact with patients, clients and other staff. He finds this task tedious and considers it the most challenging part of his job. Additionally, his work is focused on user account creation and active directory, which includes him creating user accounts, email accounts, and managing users. He also does a lot of computer imaginings. 

Compared with other I.T professionals, Zach’s position has him being more active and moving around. His environment is constantly changing as he is in sort of a leadership position and has the need to check on various things. 
</p>

<h3> Peter Wealick </h3>
<p>Peter is a computer network technician. His position typically has him working on networks, hardware, software and computer equipment.  Examples of these could be;  deploying a new workstation, fixing a wireless access point, replacing a printer/fixing a printer problem. A normal work day would have him check the monitoring and reporting service that they use for any occurrences of outages overnight, and then he would take any tickets that have been left-over from the other day and prioritize his work. 

He often interacts with service providers for support with Xerox machines, and would often have to go on site to call a customer to arrange that they're there.  However, being on site is hard as he needs to make sure he isn’t interrupting any work that's currently being done. 

What he really likes about this career is that it “is changing all the time in a good, positive way."

His position differs from other I.T professionals as he works for a smaller company which means he gets to do a lot of different jobs, which he enjoys. He has a very broad education in Information Technology and even in business which allows him to be in various positions, unlike some other I.T professionals who might only have one area of interest. 
</p>

<h3> Paray </h3>
<p> Paray is an I.T professional in the United Kingdom. He works for the company NHS as an I.T support technician. He moved to the U.K from Nigeria for education purposes, and now has a job there.

His work typically involves fixing and replacing various computer parts such as monitors. He doesn’t seem to interact with clients or the general public much, only really talking to other I.T professionals and supervisors. 

Paray spends most of his time indoors, updating and maintaining the desktops of his colleagues.   

Paray’s position in I.T is a very typical one, something you’d immediately think of when you hear “I.T professional”. As an I.T support technician, his position doesn’t differ much from other I.T professionals.
</p>

<h3> Chris Mendez </h3>
<p> Chris Mendez is a network engineer that works for NexGenT. 

First thing he likes to do in a day is to make sure there isn’t anything wrong with the switch stack, like amber lights being on or lights flickering. He also occasionally does help desk duties. He is also tasked with installing new Cisco switches. 

He spends most of his time in the basement of his work site either updating machines or running maintenance. 

He doesn't interact much with other employees unless he is doing help desk duties, which isn’t a part of his actual job. 

He doesn’t find much challenging in his line of work, however, the unpacking and installation of new technologies, while interesting, is also very tedious to him. 

Compared to other I.T professionals, Chris has a more diverse background due to his experience with I.T support as well as network engineering. 
</p>

<h3> Anna </h3>
<p> Anna is a Field Technician for Spectrum. Her position has her do cable installations, internet installations and phone installations. She is off-site, outside in various weather conditions to do her job. 

She is constantly learning, doing something new and has a rapidly changing environment, never being the same. 

She meets new people everyday as she is always face to face with her clients. She travels to her clients’ houses and does whatever installation is necessary there, and she is usually climbing telephone poles and going into attics. Since her job is a very hands-on and outdoor one, her work is usually at the mercy of weather conditions. For her, going to work in summer and hot weather conditions is the most challenging aspect of her job.

She enjoys the independence her job offers, however, it is also a challenge as the free-roam nature of her work can seem daunting, which is why she has a support network to fall back on. 

Anna’s position wildly differs from others in the I.T field. She is constantly on the move and is almost never at a desk, unlike other I.T professionals. Her job not only requires metal labor, but also physical labor as well.

 <p> Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that are capable of driving itself with little to no input or attention from the driver. These vehicles 'rely on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and powerful processors to execute software' (Synopsys n.d.). 

The most known brand for autonomous vehicles is Tesla, whose vehicles also all completely run on electricity instead of traditional petrol. Their cars are able to drive completely on their own, meaning the driver can simply relax inside, watch a movie, read or book, or even take a nap. They are also significantly more quiet than traditional petrol cars that use engines. This is due to the fact that Tesla cars run on electric motors with rechargeable batteries. And because they run on electricity, they are also more eco-friendly since there will be no carbon emissions from the exhaust. In addition to that, they are also potentially safer because technology is more consistent than humans, who are more unpredictable. According to the World Health Organisation (2021), 'approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes'. Tesla's latest model, the 'Model 3', is said to ensure the highest amount of safety for the passengers with 'an ANCAP 5-star safety rating overall and in every category' (Tesla, Inc. n.d.). In the future, electric autonomous vehicles will likely become more accessible, meaning that there will potentially be a reduction in road accidents and a reduction in carbon air pollution. 

The major impact of autonomous vehicles would be quality of life. It will make getting from one location to another much easier as you wouldn't have to manually drive the car. This would especially benefit elderly people the most who may have difficulty with driving due to complications such as poor eyesight or movement. Carbon emissions could be reduced as there would be less usage of petrol. As autonomous vehicles are closely related to electric vehicles, the switch from petrol/oil to electric will overall benefit us in the long run as oil is a limited resource on our planet. 

In my day to day life, an autonomous vehicle can be a drastic improvement in terms of convenience and overall quality of life. Similarly, having a regular car is convenient enough to get to places instead of having to rely on public transport, autonomous cars will have essentially the same benefit but with much less effort. Of course, you would still have to pay attention to the road and your surroundings, but not as much as when you're manually driving a car.

<p> Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Makey Makey are all advanced electronic hardware kits that are easily accessible to almost anyone. All of them achieve similar goals but some can accomplish more advanced/complicated tasks than others. Makey Makey is straightforward and easier to learn, while Raspberry Pi and Arduino are more advanced. Raspberry Pi and Arduino allow for users to create their own devices and develop their own software and programs to enhance their lives.

Raspberry Pi's 4th model is their latest model and is described as 'your tiny, dual-display, desktop computer…and robot brains, smart home hub, media centre, networked AI core, factory controller, and much more' (Raspberry Ltd n.d.). It is great for performing multiple tasks, controlling complex robots, playing videos, connecting to the internet, etc. Unlike their previous models, this one is built with a 'complete desktop experience' (Raspberry Ltd n.d.) that can run with dual-desktop in 4K. And like their previous models, it can also be used for other projects such as making whole new devices.

Arduino has an extensive collection of products under varying categories, where each specialise in their own thing and have their own advantages over other models. Instead of a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi, Arduino is instead a microcontroller. Therefore they are good for repetitive tasks such as turning the lights on and off, opening and closing the garage door, reading the temperature from sensors, etc. Arduino offers kits that contain a multitude of their products to get users started with learning computing. According to Arduino Hardware (n.d.), all their products go under a certain family such as the 'Nano Family', 'MKR Family' and 'Classic Family'. Each of these families have their own uses and advantages over one another, but none of them make another redundant or useless.

'Makey Makey Classic' is Makey Makey's most popular product. It is designed for users aged eight and up and allows for them to turn any everyday object into computer keys and/or controllers. Unlike the other two hardware kits, this one is significantly easier to learn and allows even kids to learn the ideas behind software development and simple computing. 

In the years to come, these technologies will allow almost everyone to learn computing, whether it be advanced or easy. People may eventually develop ground-breaking devices that can change people's lives. This will definitely impact our world, where technology is becoming more advanced, and people will be able to create and develop new projects and ideas. In a similar way, this can also affect my life in the same way it will affect other people's lives. Minor inconveniences can be resolved or tasks can be made easier through the usage of these technologies.
