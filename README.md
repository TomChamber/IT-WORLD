<Tom>
<P> My name is Tom and my student number is S3948171, I come from a vietnamese background and my personal hobbies to do during my spare time is to surf the web or to watch videos on youtube. Web design is the part about IT that I am the most interested in and it’s also my most enjoyable part about the component. Although I have no actual personal experience in designing a website myself, personally I have tried to create some before through third party websites like skillshare and shopify which allow users to easily create websites.</p>

  <h3> Zach </h3>
  <p>In the field of Information Technology, Zach works for a hospital as an Information Systems Technician where he helps support close to 2000 people and over 1000 devices.

Some of the things that he does on a day to day basis includes general help desk ticketing management, Active Directory management, group policy management, and imaging using Microsoft Deployment Tool-kit. 

He works in a Windows 7 operated environment at the time of the video, and was updating some of their Windows XP machines while moving away from Server 2003. 

The ticketing system he uses is called “Service Desk”, which he recommends thoroughly. Everyday he checks tickets while also answering phone calls with Shoretel phones. He spends his time at multiple different locations in the day as he makes frequent visits to the hospital’s various clinics and their general facility to manage things and interact with patients, clients and other staff. He finds this task tedious and considers it the most challenging part of his job. Additionally, his work is focused on user account creation and active directory, which includes him creating user accounts, email accounts, and managing users. He also does a lot of computer imaginings. 

Compared with other I.T professionals, Zach’s position has him being more active and moving around. His environment is constantly changing as he is in sort of a leadership position and has the need to check on various things.

<h3> Peter Wealick </h3>
<p>Peter is a computer network technician. His position typically has him working on networks, hardware, software and computer equipment.  Examples of these could be;  deploying a new workstation, fixing a wireless access point, replacing a printer/fixing a printer problem. A normal work day would have him check the monitoring and reporting service that they use for any occurrences of outages overnight, and then he would take any tickets that have been left-over from the other day and prioritize his work. 

He often interacts with service providers for support with Xerox machines, and would often have to go on site to call a customer to arrange that they're there.  However, being on site is hard as he needs to make sure he isn’t interrupting any work that's currently being done. 

What he really likes about this career is that it “is changing all the time in a good, positive way."

His position differs from other I.T professionals as he works for a smaller company which means he gets to do a lot of different jobs, which he enjoys. He has a very broad education in Information Technology and even in business which allows him to be in various positions, unlike some other I.T professionals who might only have one area of interest. 
</p>

<h3> Paray </h3>
<p> Paray is an I.T professional in the United Kingdom. He works for the company NHS as an I.T support technician. He moved to the U.K from Nigeria for education purposes, and now has a job there.

His work typically involves fixing and replacing various computer parts such as monitors. He doesn’t seem to interact with clients or the general public much, only really talking to other I.T professionals and supervisors. 

Paray spends most of his time indoors, updating and maintaining the desktops of his colleagues.   

Paray’s position in I.T is a very typical one, something you’d immediately think of when you hear “I.T professional”. As an I.T support technician, his position doesn’t differ much from other I.T professionals.
</p>

<h3> Chris Mendez </h3>
<p> Chris Mendez is a network engineer that works for NexGenT. 

First thing he likes to do in a day is to make sure there isn’t anything wrong with the switch stack, like amber lights being on or lights flickering. He also occasionally does help desk duties. He is also tasked with installing new Cisco switches. 

He spends most of his time in the basement of his work site either updating machines or running maintenance. 

He doesn't interact much with other employees unless he is doing help desk duties, which isn’t a part of his actual job. 

He doesn’t find much challenging in his line of work, however, the unpacking and installation of new technologies, while interesting, is also very tedious to him. 

Compared to other I.T professionals, Chris has a more diverse background due to his experience with I.T support as well as network engineering. 
</p>

<h3> Anna </h3>
<p> Anna is a Field Technician for Spectrum. Her position has her do cable installations, internet installations and phone installations. She is off-site, outside in various weather conditions to do her job. 

She is constantly learning, doing something new and has a rapidly changing environment, never being the same. 

She meets new people everyday as she is always face to face with her clients. She travels to her clients’ houses and does whatever installation is necessary there, and she is usually climbing telephone poles and going into attics. Since her job is a very hands-on and outdoor one, her work is usually at the mercy of weather conditions. For her, going to work in summer and hot weather conditions is the most challenging aspect of her job.

She enjoys the independence her job offers, however, it is also a challenge as the free-roam nature of her work can seem daunting, which is why she has a support network to fall back on. 

Anna’s position wildly differs from others in the I.T field. She is constantly on the move and is almost never at a desk, unlike other I.T professionals. Her job not only requires metal labor, but also physical labor as well.
